## Favorite CPSC 120L Labs

Lab 2, Part 1 & 2

Although compared to our other labs this one was relatively simple thats what made it so nice. It was a nice way to introduce us into what we may be doing in the future. And for me it was my first time ever working with code. So it inspired me as I knew I would truely enjoy doing this as a profession.

Lab 4 Part 2

This lab was my second favorite as it incorporated us coding some type of game. That is part of the reason I wanted to get into the world of computer science because I wanted to see how my favorite games were made, I wanted to one day make my own. Although we didn't code the next Minecraft it was nice to see that I can get there one day. 

Lab 10 Part 2

This was my third favorite lab as it felt like I was coding something that could actually be used. Using the counties in California as well as their population to make a 2D data set so it can be easily viewed. Its a nice feeling when you know that your skills are progressing to a point where you can actually apply them to a real world situation.
